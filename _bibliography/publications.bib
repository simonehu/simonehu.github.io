  abstract = {We build and test a single-photon detector based on a Si avalanche photodiode Excelitas 30902SH thermoelectrically cooled to -100 deg. C. Our detector has dark count rate below 1 Hz, 500 um diameter photosensitive area, photon detection efficiency around 50%, afterpulsing less than 0.35%, and timing jitter under 1 ns. These characteristics make it suitable for long-distance free-space quantum communication links, which we briefly discuss. We also report an improved method that we call long-time afterpulsing analysis, used to determine and visualise long trap lifetimes at different temperatures.},

  abstract = {A Feynman period is a particular residue of a scalar Feynman integral which is both physically and number theoretically interesting. Two ways in which the graph theory of the underlying Feynman graph can illuminate the Feynman period are via graph operations which are period invariant and other graph quantities which predict aspects of the Feynman period, one notable example is known as the $c_2$ invariant. We give results and computations in both these directions, proving a new period identity and computing its consequences up to 11 loops in $\phi^4\text{--}$theory, proving a $c_2$ invariant identity, and giving the results of a computational investigation of $c_2$ invariants at 11 loops.},
