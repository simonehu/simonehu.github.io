I am a second year master's student at the [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca/math/), with the pleasure of working with [Karen Yeats](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kayeats/) in the Department of [Combinatorics & Optimization](https://www.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/).

I previously also completed my undergraduate degree there, majoring in Combinatorics & Optimization and Statistics, and with a Computational Mathematics minor.

I currently think about the combinatorics of quantum field theory, more specifically on the graphs behind scattering amplitudes and the properties of a related arithmetic invariant called the $$c_2$$-invariant.
<br/>I also have recently thought about Le diagrams and other associated combinatorial objects.
